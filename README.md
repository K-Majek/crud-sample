Code samples of the work I usually did

Each folder contains a separate project which you can open up, and I have got a dilemma if to mock it up into some local memory stuff or if actually use the SQL queries.
I believe if would be revieved by technical people, so let's make it as sql. If there will be some kind of issue with that, just issue me a PR with message.

If repository is empty, please wait, as I probably have tons of work and have to schedule the commits later.
